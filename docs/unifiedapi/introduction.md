## What is Alloy Embedded?

Alloy Embedded is a powerful Embedded iPaaS designed to help you streamline data flows between applications.

By embedding a simple SDK, you can instantly add support for the over 270+ (and growing) integrations  within your own application. Alloy Embedded takes away the complexity and time consuming effort of building integrations in house. After you've embedded our SDK, Alloy Embedded infrastructure handles all the behind the scenes work â€“ OAuth, redirects, credential management, field mapping, rate limiting, batching, and much more.
