# Overview

Our new feature addresses two key areas:

- Enhanced Naming Convention: We're giving you the power to create more distinguishable and context-rich names for your integrations.
- Streamlined Editing Process: This includes a unified approach to editing both API keys and OAuth connections.

## Solutions

We're introducing a two-pronged approach:

1. **Editable Credential Names**
   - **User Control:** You can now edit the default name of your integrations.
   - **Descriptive Labels:** Assign names that are meaningful and relevant to your workflow.
2. **Unified Editing Experience**
   - **Consistent Editing:** We've streamlined the editing process for both API keys and OAuth integrations.
   - **Universal Functionality:** Either both integration types will have an "edit" option, or we'll introduce a new term that applies to both, enhancing overall usability.

## How to Use this Feature

### Editing Integration Names

1. Navigate to Integration Settings: Find the integration you want to rename.
2. Edit Name: Click on the default name and type in your preferred label.
3. Save Changes: Confirm your new name to keep it updated.

### Managing Credentials

- API Keys: Use the "edit" option to modify your API keys directly.
- OAuth Connections: Either use the "edit" feature or the newly introduced universal function, depending on our final implementation.
